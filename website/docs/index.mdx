## Quick Install

```bash
# Install packages
bun add @soda-gql/core @soda-gql/runtime
bun add -D @soda-gql/cli @soda-gql/config
```

## How It Works

soda-gql brings [PandaCSS](https://panda-css.com/)'s approach to GraphQL. Instead of generating types from queries, you write type-safe queries directly in TypeScript:

1. **Define fragments** - Reusable field selections for types
2. **Create operations** - Query, mutation, or subscription definitions
3. **Compose** - Embed fragments into operations
4. **Build** - Transform at build time into optimized GraphQL documents

All with full type inference and zero runtime overhead.
